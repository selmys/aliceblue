# Date: Summer 2012, Winter 2019
#
# Notes: 
#   1. This script should be run in a Gnome Terminal
#      with BASH version 4 or better to work properly
#   2. You'll need to install the dconf command using
#          sudo apt-get install dconf-cli
#   3. You'll need to install the resize command using
#          sudo apt-get install xterm
#
# To run the script enter
#		./aliceblue 


# obviously this function should perform a restart
# setting all data to initial values, except of course,
# the initial room is chosen randomally

[1,1,a]="It's ${red}morning${off}."
[1,1,Q]="It's ${red}testing${off}."
[1,1,b]="I can tell that it's morning because there is a little ${red}light${off} filtering in through the ${red}window${off}." 
[1,1,c]="A single, high-set opening in the ${red}stone${off} allows a smudge of ${red}dawnlight${off} to trickle in past thick ${red}cobwebs${off} laden with the husks of ${red}flies${off}." 
[1,2,a]="I am in ${red}bed${off}." 
[1,2,b]="In the ${red}corner${off} there is an old moth-eaten ${red}quilt${off}, settled atop a pile of ${red}straw${off}. This is where I ${red}sleep${off}." 
[1,3,a]="The ${red}door${off} is to the south." 
[1,3,b]="The door is locked. It looks like it's made of rotten ${red}wood${off}, but it's really strong. There is a ${red}keyhole${off}, but no doorknob." 
[1,4,a]="I often dream of digging a ${red}hole${off} here and climbing out into the ${red}sunlight${off}. There are shallow scratches on the ${red}stone${off}, and my ${red}fingernails${off} are worn to nothing." 
[1,4,b]="I pull back the mildewy straw and uncover a tiny ${red}recess${off} where the ${red}mortar${off} has been pried loose." 
[1,4,c]="Out of the recess, I pull a ${red}key${off} made of ${yellow}ivory${off} coloured ${red}bone${off}." 
[1,4,d]="The ${yellow}ivory${off} key is clearly the work of many sleepless nights. I vaguely recall the feel of it,trembling in my palm as I painstakingly grind it into shape against a burr in the wall. A pang of fear sings in my heart. I'm not sure why." 
[1,5,a]="Stone: The walls, the ceiling, the floor, all of the same rough-hewn grey." 
[1,5,b]="Dawnlight: I bathe my face in the fragile, liquid illumination. The ${red}sunlight${off} will only be here for a few minutes more." 
[1,5,c]="Sunlight: It triggers a memory: lying on my ${red}stomach${off} in the sun, while my ${red}grandmother${off} plaits my ${red}hair${off}." 
[1,5,d]="Grandmother: She's not here." 
[1,5,e]="Hair: A matted mess, short-shorn." 
[1,5,f]="Cobwebs: If I could brush them away, I would be able to get more ${red}sunlight${off} in here, but I can't reach." 
[1,5,g]="Flies: Those that haven't been caught are hovering in a thick cloud near my ${red}bed${off}." 
[1,5,h]="Quilt: It smells bad, but there's nowhere to wash it." 
[1,5,i]="Sleep: ...I daren't." 
[1,5,j]="Fingernails: They were beautiful once. Now they're chipped and raw." 
[1,5,k]="Mortar: It's old and crumbly, and I remember that it tastes like chalk." 
[1,5,l]="Bone: A slender bit of bleached ${yellow}ivory${off} from the carcasse of some poor unfortunate creature. I prefer to imagine it belonged to a ${red}cat${off}." 
[1,5,m]="Cat: I think I used to have a cat, but I might just be imagining it." 
[1,5,n]="Footsteps: This must be why I'm afraid." 
[1,5,o]="Wood: Oak." 
[1,5,p]="Keyhole: Looking through the keyhole, I can see some ${red}stairs${off}. I hear ${red}someone${off} moving out there." 
[1,5,q]="Someone: My first impulse is to shout for help, but something stops me. I wish I knew who it was, walking around." 
[1,5,r]="Stairs: They lead up. There's ${red}someone${off} moving around, out of sight, at the top." 
[1,5,s]="Stomach: Empty." 
[1,5,A]="I am in a small room, little more than a cage, with a squalid pile of straw in the corner for a bed. As the door creaks open on rusty hinges, I hide a home-made key in a crack in the stone, pushing the straw quickly back in place. There is a woman standing there, old, with a rottenapple face. She squints at me short-sightedly. I am stronger than her, I'm sure, and yet I feel certain that if I pushed past her and ran, I would suffer some terrible punishment. I bow my head. Breakfast time, she says. There's work to do today."
[1,5,X]="You are carrying a heavy heart."
[2,1,a]="The ${red}board${off} is laid out with ${red}food${off}." 
[2,1,b]="A humble wooden board, with one ${red}leg${off} shorter than the others, bears our ${red}meal${off} on its back." 
[2,1,d]="${red}Breakfast${off} is served on a humble wooden table, which ${red}wobbles${off} slightly. The old ${red}woman${off} bends over the ${red}pot${off}." 
[2,1,z]="The old ${red}woman${off} stands next to a ${red}table${off}, laid out with ${red}breakfast${off}." 
[2,2,a]="I dare not take anything until I've been called." 
[2,2,b]="${red}She${off} takes down a ${red}plate${off} and dishes up a hefty helping of sweet baked beans${off}. A fat, juicy ${red}sausage${off} is laid beside it. ${red}She${off} puts it down and serves up another." 
[2,2,c]="Victuals: ${red}Breakfast${off} smells so good. ${red}Beans${off}. ${red}Sausage${off}. Maybe I could I ${red}eat${off} just a ${red}little${off}." 
[2,3,a]="The old ${red}woman${off} leads me forward and makes me sit. ${red}She${off} takes an iron ${red}chain${off} out of her ${red}pocket${off} and slips one end around a ${red}shortened${off} table-leg, the other around my ${red}ankle${off}, holding the ${red}loops${off} together with ${red}pins${off}." 
[2,3,b]="I am bound to the table by a slender iron chain. It looks like it would break if I ${red}pulled${off}, but the raw pain around my ${red}ankle${off} tells a different story." 
[2,3,c]="The woman is wearing an apron, with a large ${red}pocket${off} in the front. ${red}Eat${off} up your ${red}victuals${off}, she says." 
[2,3,d]="Oh, the old woman scolds, You'd like to see what I have in my pocket, wouldn't you? Just ${red}ask${off}, and I'll ${red}show${off} you."
[2,3,e]="My ${red}ankle${off} refuses to fight. The body remembers pain, even when the mind forgets. I have already failed at this."
[2,4,a]="The sausage is bursting with ${red}fat${off}, stuffed with ${red}parsley${off} and rich brown bread ${red}crumbs${off}. It's only the ${red}meat${off}..." 
[2,4,b]="The sausage is bursting with ${red}fat${off}, stuffed with ${red}parsley${off} and rich brown bread ${red}crumbs${off}. No matter how appetizing it looks, I remember that I must not ${red}eat${off}."
[2,4,c]="Eat: I can't eat any of this delicious breakfast, because it's ${red}Oliver${off}." 
[2,5,a]="The leg is shortened so that ${red}something${off} can be slipped on and off." 
[2,5,b]="Something I don't like, but I don't remember what." 
[2,5,c]="The body remembers pain, even when the mind forgets. I have already failed at this." 
[2,5,d]="Ankle: It is bruised, with a deep welt in exactly the place where the chain pulls against it." 
[2,5,e]="Loops: The chain around my ankle is very tight. It hurts." 
[2,5,f]="Pins: Just as the chain looks easy to snap, the pins should be easy to pull out. But if you touch them, they burn like hot irons." 
[2,5,g]="Baked Beans: The beans look so delicious, and I'm so hungry. I wish that I could eat." 
[2,5,h]="Fat: Crispy, fried fat. So tempting." 
[2,5,i]="Parsley: There's a ${red}garden${off} full of it just outside the ${red}window${off}." 
[2,5,j]="Garden: The old woman's garden. It's outside." 
[2,5,k]="Window:The window is frosted, like spun ${red}sugar${off}. It lets light in, but you can't see out." 
[2,5,l]="Sugar: Everything is reminding me of food." 
[2,5,m]="Bread Crumbs: If only I had trail of them to follow ${red}home${off}..." 
[2,5,n]="Home: Far, far away."
[2,5,o]="Oliver: He was a ${red}goat${off}, my ${red}friend${off}."
[2,5,p]="Friend: Friends don't eat friends." 
[2,5,q]="Goat: A frisky, friendly, free-gamboling creature, now ground up for ${red}sausage${off} meat." 
[2,5,r]="Pot: It's full of ${red}beans${off}, fried in ${red}fat${off}." 
[2,5,s]="Little: I must be going insane. It's the hunger that does it." 
[2,5,t]="Never ask. Never ${red}tell${off}. Never ${red}speak${off}. I do ${red}remember${off} that." 
[2,5,u]="She'll never tell me. Not unless I ${red}ask${off}. There's something in there, though, round, and roly-poly, that smells like ${yellow}papayawhip${off}." 
[2,5,v]="Speak: Never." 
[2,5,w]="Tell: Never."
[2,5,x]="Remember: If only I could." 
# 5x used to be double plotted. I have changed one of them to 5z.
[2,5,z]="Shortened Table-leg: It's cut short to accomodate the iron loop."
[2,5,y]="Sausage: Flesh bound in skin."
[2,5,A]="I remember. My favourite desert, the smell of it released in a magical cloud as the golden lid is whisked from the serving tray. Fruit brought from a thousand miles away, carefully cut into long, chewy orange strips, dried, soaked, cut, whipped together with fresh-skimmed cream. Strange, how sharply scent can trigger a memory. The remembrance of food past only whets my appetite for the feast laid out before me. I am attached to the table with a slender chain of iron which will not break. I think that I must have tried to escape once before. The old woman sits down across from me. She slurps noisily at her beans, allows the fat of her sausage to dribble down her chin. I sit and look desperately at the plate of food in front of me. I must not eat. I must not eat. I'm so hungry. Finally, she finishes and looks at me. You'd better eat up, she says, I have a lot for you to do today. I won't have you weak. \nI don't touch a morsel. When she sees that I won't eat, she returns the food to the pot. “A matter of time, she says, only a matter of time. She takes off her apron and hangs it on a peg. We're going to be outside today. I think you'll like that."
[3,1,a]="A ${red}garden${off}." 
[3,1,b]="${red}Eleven${off} ${red}plots${off}, neatly arranged in a ${red}grid${off} pattern, growing ${red}fruits${off} and ${red}vegetables${off}."
[3,1,c]="Eleven little ${red}beds${off}, sleeping side by side, form a neat ${red}grid${off}, laden with ${red}fruits${off} and ${red}vegetables${off}."
[3,1,d]="Eleven ${red}beds${off} are arranged in a three by four pattern, each growing different ${red}fruits${off} and ${red}vegetables${off}, but one corner is ${red}vacant${off}, covered in scrubby ${red}weeds${off}."
[3,2,a]="The ${red}garden${off} is beside a pleasant looking ${red}cottage${off}."
[3,2,b]="Next to the ${red}garden${off} is a small ${red}dwelling${off} with ${red}gingerbreading${off} around the ${red}eaves${off}."
[3,2,c]="The ${red}woman${off} is ${red}standing${off} beside her little ${red}hut${off}."
[3,2,d]="The ${red}woman${off} is leaning, crook-backed, against her ${red}hut${off}."
[3,3,a]="Each bed is slightly ${red}raised${off}, suggesting a chest raised by ${red}breath${off}."
[3,3,b]="The ${red}earth${off} is well ${red}tilled${off}, with ${red}compost${off} mixed in."
[3,3,c]="The dark, rich soil has been dug ${red}deep${off}, and ${red}compost${off} mixed in."
[3,3,d]="Composted bone and blood ${red}meal${off} is mixed into the ${red}deep${off}-tilled soil."
[3,3,e]="I climb up a ${red}tree${off}, unto the roof, and sit looking over the ${red}world${off}. The ${red}sunlight${off} is warm on my ${red}cheek${off}. Beautiful."
[3,3,f]="I can see the ${red}pines${off} closing in around the cottage from all sides. The ${red}sunlight${off} is warm on my ${red}cheek${off}."
[3,3,g]="The hut is where we came from. Superficially pleasant, but full of ${red}sorrows${off}."
[3,3,h]="Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow? With ${red}silver${off} bells, and ${red}cockleshells${off}, and pretty ${red}maids${off} all in a row, my ${red}captor${off} sings in a croaking voice. She picks up a ${red}pitchfork${off} and leads me to the ${red}vacant${off} back corner of the garden."
[3,3,i]="The old woman is remarkably ugly. The folds of skin at her neck are twisted, as though someone once tried, and failed, to kill her. She uses the ${red}pitchfork${off} like a staff as she leads me towards the ${red}vacant${off} bed."
[3,3,j]="I take the tool reluctantly from her ${red}hand${off} and begin pushing it ${red}deep${off} into the soil. The ${red}weeds${off} have grasping ${red}roots${off} that are hard to turn up. I'm so weak, sweating and trembling from the exertion. The ${red}sun${off}, my old friend, has turned against me. It beats down hard. I feel like I'm going to ${red}faint${off}. ${red}Faster${off}, the old woman says, ${red}Faster${off}. I need to plant my ${yellow}honeydew${off}."
[3,4,a]="There is a patch of ${red}parsley${off} growing under the ${red}windowsill${off}."
[3,4,b]="The window looks back into the kitchen. A patch of ${red}parsley${off} grows beneath it."
[3,4,c]="When no one is looking, I reach down and grab a handful of parsley, gobbling it ravenously. It tastes unbelievably good. Even though I know that there isn't really much nutrition in it, it lifts my spirits and seems to give me strength."
[3,5,a]="Fruits and vegetables: They look delicious, but they're not ripe yet."
[3,5,b]="I like thinking of the gardens lying there, breathlessly awaiting their produce."
[3,5,c]="No, not six feet deep. I must be getting paranoid."
[3,5,d]="Bone and blood meal: A very rich fertilizer."
[3,5,e]="I can't recall who lives here."
[3,5,f]="Gingerbreading: I think, unaccountably - nibble nibble, like a mouse, who's been nibbling at my house?"
[3,5,g]="Eaves: You know, the edge of a ${red}roof${off}."
[3,5,h]="Tree: I think it's a yew."
[3,5,i]="Sunlight: It triggers a memory: lying in the sun, while my ${red}grandmother${off} plaits my ${red}hair${off}."
[3,5,I]="Grandmother: She's not here."
[3,5,j]="Hair: It used to be long and golden."
[3,5,k]="Cheek: A maiden blush bepaints it."
[3,5,l]="I shed a tear, remembering my poor ${red}Oliver${off}."
[3,5,m]="Vacant: Stark. Empty. A conspicuous vacancy."
[3,5,n]="Weeds: They're not very healthy. The soil must be poor."
[3,5,o]="Silver bells: Pretty little flowers, nodding sleepily on the borders of the ${red}beds${off}."
[3,5,p]="They remind me of the seashore, and make me feel strangely sad."
[3,5,q]="I used to be pretty. That was a long time ago."
[3,5,r]="Old, withered, merciless."
[3,5,s]="Black, tuberous, with tough, fibrous tendrils leaching the soil dry."
[3,5,t]="It's not his fault he's so hot. I forgive him."
[3,5,u]="I momentarily let go of my consciousness. A painful tug at my ankle restores me to my senses."
[3,5,v]="I'm working as fast as I can."
[3,5,w]="Pines: A vast forest."
[3,5,x]="He was a ${red}goat${off}, my ${red}friend${off}."
[3,5,y]="Friend: A necessary risk."
[3,5,z]="Goat: They like to eat ${red}weeds${off}."
[3,5,A]="I have finished turning up the vacant square of soil at the back of the cottage garden. A shudder passes through me and I sink to my knees, totally exhausted. The old woman laughs. She leaves me there, thinking that I'm too weak even to try escaping. Now to get the fertilizer, she says. You stay here. Quiet as a mouse.” I can't believe my luck. My chance, at last. I watch as her knobbly back retreats into the hut. I gather my strength. I wait."
[4,1,a]="A ${red}forest${off}, seemingly ${red}endless${off}, ${red}pine${off}."
[4,1,b]="A seemingly ${red}endless${off} stand of close-planted ${red}pine${off} trees, its ${red}floor${off} softly padded with saddle-brown ${red}needles${off}."
[4,1,B]="A seemingly ${red}endless${off} stand of close-planted ${red}pine${off} trees, its ${red}floor${off} softly padded with ${red}needles${off}."
[4,1,c]="The ${red}red${off} pines are planted closely together, ${red}whispering${off} to one another in the ${red}breeze${off}. The seem to go on ${red}endlessly${off}, in all directions."
[4,2,a]="Of course the ${red}forest${off} isn't really endless. I just don't ${red}remember${off} the ${red}way${off} out."
[4,5,a]="Remember: There are lots of things I don't remember."
[4,5,b]="Way: Out there. Somewhere. I hope."
[4,1,d]="As I study the floor beneath the ${red}endless pine trees${off}, I can see ${red}mushrooms${off} poking up from under the soft carpetting of ${red}needles${off}."
[4,5,c]="Mushrooms: ${red}amanita muscaria${off} - the ${red}Death-Cap${off}."
[4,5,d]="Amanita muscaria: A ${red}hallucinogenic${off}, spotted, firebrick specimen of the amanita genus."
[4,5,e]="Hallucinogenic: I'm already confused enough."
[4,5,f]="Death Cap: I don't know why, but it's true. Death wears a hat."
[4,5,g]="Red-to-yellow: No two are the same."
[4,2,b]="Whisper. Whisper. Doubtless ${red}harpies${off}, muttering in their ${red}sleep${off}."
[4,2,c]="The harpies prefer to ${red}hunt${off} at ${red}night${off}."
[4,2,j]="I could crouch here, catch something to eat, but I am the hunted."
[4,2,h]="Sensations are heightened."
[4,2,d]="A little ways off, I can see a particularly ${red}impressive${off} old ${red}cedar${off}."
[4,2,e]="An old cedar tree with a ${red}twisted${off} trunk stands surrounded by pines."
[4,2,f]="The trunk winds around on itself, like a ${red}coiled${off} snake."
[4,2,g]="Involuntarily, I look around for the ${red}animal${off} which the shape of the tree suggests. I don't see any snakes here."
[4,2,k]="I can tell, by the ${red}tracks${off}, that all sorts of animals live amongst the pines, but I can't see any. Perhaps they're not awake."
[4,2,i]="Animal tracks criss-cross here and there, but they're hard to make out. The ${red}pine-needles${off} won't hold an imprint."

Exhausted, I fall to the ground. She picks binds my ankle with an iron chain and brings me over to the freshly cultivated earth, plants my feet in the rich soil, and begins to mutter quietly to herself. I feel my feet transforming, roots going far down into the earth. I stretch my hands upwards, desperately, as if I could grab hold of the sky and pull myself free. My arms solidify in that position. The old woman goes into the house, brings out her apron, and begins to pluck my scattered memories, like fruit from my branches."

[4,4,l]="I push into the soft surfaces of my ${red}memory${off}. A long ${red}time${off} ago. The forest in ${red}winter${off}. Which way was the ${red}sunlight${off} slanting?"

[4,4,u]="A shadow. I turn. It leaps. I hold the pitchfork out in front of me, and the creature yelps, loud, as it is impaled on the tines. The weight of it knocks me over. Its claws graze my thigh as it kicks helplessly against its impending death. I lie pressed beneath it, and it grows heavier by the moment, crushing me down. I look up, into its face, which has turned towards me.
'I knew you,' it says. It isn't a wolf. A man. Someone that I knew.
'I'm sorry. I didn't know.'
'You knew.'
I don't have any words for that.
