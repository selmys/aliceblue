A stiff breeze is [0;31mblowing[0m through the [0;31mpine trees[0m, inciting them to [0;31mwhisper[0m darkly to one another.
Animal tracks criss-cross here and there, but they're hard to make out. The [0;31mpine-needles[0m won't hold an imprint.
The needles crunch beneath my bare [0;31mfeet[0m. My soles are sensitive to their [0;31mpricking[0m. It reminds me of something. Something that frightens me.
I am [0;31mrunning[0m hard, the pine-needles [0;31mpricking[0m beneath my [0;31mfeet[0m.
Impressive: It sends a shiver down my spine.
